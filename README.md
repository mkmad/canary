# Canary
Monitoring Service for Openstack Taskflow's Jobboards

# How does it work?
*Task-ception*

Taskflow is used to monitor other job-boards, and post to cassandra with its outputs.

# Console Scripts

```python
canary-producer
```

Canary's own producer process that posts jobs to Canary's jobboard

```python
canary-worker
```

Canary's conductor which pulls jobs off Canary's jobboard, to query
paths submitted to it (using Taskflow) and post to cassandra with a timestamp

```python
canary-server
```

Canary's WSGI server that serves job counts and corresponding jobs, over the period
of last `x` seconds (which is set as interval under canary.conf)
